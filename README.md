# glitch-vision

This project uses Audacity's scripting interface to glitch images by treating them as raw audio data. By converting images into TIF format, importing them into Audacity, applying audio effects (like Change Speed, Tempo, EQ, etc.), and exporting them back to image form, we recreate chaotic visual distortions â€” sometimes referred to as datamoshing.

The goal is to batch-process glitching workflows for images and videos without manually operating Audacity.
